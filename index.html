  <div id="introduction">
    <p>Hello! I am a currently a final year Master's student in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. My interests primarily lie in control theory and dynamical systems; I love that they are able to describe and unify a wide range of engineering problems.</p>
    <p>The full list of modules I have taken are shown on my <a href = "./AFrench-Transcript.pdf" target = "_blank">academic transcript.</a></p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    
    <h3>Third Year Project: SoleMate</h3>
    <a href="./SoleMate.pdf" target = "_blank"><img src = "solemate.png" alt = "A diagram of SoleMate system" width = "800"/></a>
    <p>This project was submitted for the B3: Group Design Project for an MEng in Engineering Science at University of Oxford.<br>It describes the design of a novel somatosensory feedback replacement device to improve the walking gait of lower limb amputees.</p>
    <p><a href="./SoleMate.pdf" target = "_blank">Read the full pdf!</a></p>
   
    <h3>Mathworks Minidrone competition</h3>
    <a href = "https://eng.ox.ac.uk/news/oxford-engineering-triumph-team-orville-secures-third-place-in-mathworks-minidrone-competition/" target = "_blank"><img src = "minidrone.png" width = "800"></a>
    <p>At the end of my second year of university, I entered the MathWorks Minidrone competition with 3 other Oxford students in Maths and Engineering. We programmed a quadrotor to use data from and onboard camera to follow an unseen path and land on a landing pad.</p>

    <h3>EPSRC-funded Research Project: Model free control policy search for liftable systems</h3>
    <a href = "./EPSRC_poster.pdf" target = "_blank"><img src = ".epsrc.png" width = "200></a>
    <p>This project focused on testing the convergence of gradient descent methods to find the optimal LQR controller for nonlinear systems with a Koopman-invariant subaspace. I then presented my <a href = "EPSRC_poster.pdf" target = "_blank">findings</a> at a poster presentation.</p>

  <h2>Specialist Courses</h2>
  <p>My degree is a general Engineering Science degree, however I have specialised into control and information engineering through various specialist courses. My third year options include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>B14: Information Systems</li>
    <li>B15: Control Systems</li>
    <li>B16: Software Engineering</li>
  </ul>
