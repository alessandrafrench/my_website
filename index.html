  <div id="introduction">
    <p>Hello! I am a currently a final year Master's student in Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. My interests primarily lie in control theory and dynamical systems; I love that they are able to describe such a wide range of engineering systems.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Third Year Project: SoleMate</h3>
    <p>This project was submitted for the B3:Group Design Project for an MEng in Engineering Science at Uni of Oxford.<br>It describes the design of a novel somatosensory feedback replacement device to improve the walking gait of lower limb amputees.</p>

    <h3>Mathworks Minidrone competition</h3>
    <p>At the end of my second year of university, I entered the MathWorks Minidrone competition with 3 other Oxford students in Maths and Engineering. We programmed a quadrotor to use data from and onboard camera to follow an unseen path and land on a landing pad.</p>
